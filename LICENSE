Parabol is distributed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3.0
and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly with
Parabol, Inc. If you obtained Action under the GPL, then the GPL applies to all
loadable Parabol modules used on your system as well, except as defined below.
The GPL (version 3) is included in this source tree in the file COPYING.

Parabol, Inc. holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all components of
the Parabol package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability
for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary or Open
Source (even if not GPL) modules which may be dynamically linked at runtime with
the portions of Parabol which fall under our copyright/license umbrella, or are
distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there is no
requirement that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products (although
if you've written a module for Parabol we would strongly encourage you to make
the same exception that we do).
